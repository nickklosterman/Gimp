choose a image w strong shadows, possibly BW image
threshold -> oilify -> pixelize -> oilify -> possibly threshold again if want pure BW

for color images
brightness / contrast -> desaturate -> oilify

play w brightness / contrast to get appropriate shading

oilify -> bright/contr -> threshold -> oilify -> pixelize

I need some type of palette knife filter to create the sharp edges that mignola does

possibly use tiling to get the angular look to the art

I feel like for the most part its just play with brightness/contrast and then threshold to get the feel you want.

possibly use edge detect to help separate some areas you want to keep dark or light

theshold -> pixelize -> oilify
