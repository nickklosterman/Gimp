Anaglyph script:
----------------
get gimp-levels working
save off a thumbnail for uploading on DA
If I knew how to work the gui I could wrap the wiggle stereoscopy and anaglyph items all into one and have a menu for the user to select the options appropriately
Ask if have a displ map and if do prompt to select
ask if want to stretch levels
ask if want to contract levels
ask if anaglyph or wiggle

automate and perform in imagemagick

CrayonPixelArt
-------------
DONE have new images created for each type of dithering
-now name each of those separate images so we know which dithering was done and what interp was done
